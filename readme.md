# Kgl - Kotlin Multiplatform OpenGL abstraction

This is a thin OpenGL wrapper library for Kotlin Multiplatform.

**Note: this library is a work-in-progress, the set of functions is incomplete.** I used it for my multiplatform game [Skyway](https://skyway.danielgergely.com).
Despite it not being ready I can still recommend using it, since it's designed to be as thin a layer as possible, it might be a good start for other projects as well, it's easy to extend and troubleshoot if necessary. 

## Implemented platforms
